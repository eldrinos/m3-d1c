While using M3-D1c at NYCC the following obverstvations about battery life where noted post event
1) the anker battery that powered the dome used about 25% of power during the 8 or 9 hours it was on
2) the ryobi 18V 8.0Ah battery for the boddy still consumed about 25% of its life just doing occasional sounds
Further observations about battery life are needed with a fully functioning droid
