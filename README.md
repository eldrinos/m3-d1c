# m3-d1c
This the home for the project documentation for M3-D1C, everybody's favorite medic R2 unit. There are no warranties here, only force prophecies and spanners. Take a look on IG @m3d1c_the_astromech.

## Documentation
The aim of this repo is to make sure we've got all the technical specs in one place so nobody goes crazy looking for them. With that in mind, we'll also look to populate a wiki here with the appropriate plaintext info.

## To-Do Management
If there's something what need done, create a new issue or use the Projects view to attach it to the repo. Tasklists are extra useful for this for more complicated issues.
